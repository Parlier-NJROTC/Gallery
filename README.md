# Gallery Repository

Welcome to our gallery repository. We got tired of manually downloading a giant images folder every time

## How does it work
We have a script that gets the URLs of every image.
Put the URL in groups of 30 or 10 or any number  we choose in a JSON file.
When generating the gallery we read the JSON and make a page for each group.

Very nice and we don't have to repeat ourselves, it's the computer's job now :D

## How to add
1. Create a GitHub Account
2. Email anyone in the organization to give you admin
3. Navigate back here
4. Click add file or the '+' button
5. Upload files.
Should be self-explanatory from there, just commit the changes, and et voila.

# Gallery Reposetory

Welcome to our gallery reposetory. We got tired of manually downloading a gaint images folder every time

## How does it work

We have a script that gets the urls of every image.

Put the url in groups of 30 or 10 or any number  we choose in a json file.

When genorating the gallery we read the json and make a page for each group.

Very nice and we don't have to reapet our selves, its the computer's job now :D

## How to add
1. Create a github Account
2. Email anyone in the organization to give you admin
3. Navigate back here
4. Click add file or the '+' button
5. Upload files
5. Upload files.
Should be self explainatory from there, just commit the changes and et voila.
